Analyze your netflix data

You can get your own viewing statistics from Netflix. Use the https://www.netflix.com/account/getmyinfo link, where you can request a copy of your information. They will notify you within a couple of days in an email, when you will have another couple of days to download a .zip file following the provided link. 

Look for ViewingActivity.csv within the zip. I did all the manipulation on that file. 

For privacy purposes I've removed the origianl user names from the file, which will get replaced at the start anyway. For the very same reason I'm not uploading my sample files, only one of the plots.
